# Prompting strategies

The generated prompt follows the rough format of:

1. Background knowledge: descriptions of educational taxonomies relevant for the prompt and, if given, extra background information provided by the user.
2. Pre-instructions (context): what information to pay special heed to from the background knowledge as well as extra user provided information about the education in question.
3. Instruction: what to generate, incl. output formatting.
